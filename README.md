## Authors : 

Lioz Elmalem and Snir Shaharabani.

## About the project:

In this assignment,we first had to watch the spacecraft "Beresheet" crash video and learn from it what caused the crash (what we're not being told).
Then the main goal was to develop a two-dimensional simulation of a spacecraft landing on the moon based on what we learned from the Genesis crash.
In this assignment we have developed a PID control that allows the autonomous spacecraft to land safely on the moon's land and in addition with a small amount of fuel. 


## How to use the project:

* Download the project zip to your eclipse or intellij

* In class "Simulator", change the "BackroundPath" and the "SpacecraftPath" to yours (where you store the moon and the spacecraft jpg/png files).

* Click start
