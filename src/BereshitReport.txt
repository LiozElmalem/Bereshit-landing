						Bereshit crash fault reasons

According to Wikipedia : "during the spacecraft landing on April 11, 2019,
it appeared that due to failure of one of the spacecraft's accelerometers,
a chain of events resulted in the engine being shut down and failure to land."

According to Jerusalem post : "A command intended to correct a malfunction in one of the Beresheet spacecraftâ€™s inertial measurement unit led to a 
chain of events that turned off its main engine during landing, according to a preliminary investigation conducted by SpaceIL."

According to Globes : "An initial probe by Israel Aerospace Industries and SpaceIL, following the crash on the moon of Israeli spacecraft Beresheet last Thursday, 
showed a malfunction in the spaceship's acceleration measurement components, leading to a series of malfunctions that caused the engine to shut down. 
The spacecraft failed to successfully decelerate for a soft landing on the moon, hit the surface with full force, and disintegrated."

Naturally there is a lot of information that is not available to us , but
the lessons we have already passed, we have noticed the importance of a stable control system whose operations are supposed to be 
generic and stable for changes. Communication problems have taken up a relatively large space here.
